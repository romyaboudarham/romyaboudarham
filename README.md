## Hi, I'm Romy!

**Creative Technologist**
-- I work at the intersection of design and engineering, using emerging technologies to reduce the friction between design intent and implementation. 
Currently based in the bay area working as a creative technologist at [California College of the Arts](https://www.cca.edu) and managing the Prototyping lab, where I design and help build the technical side of student projects.
